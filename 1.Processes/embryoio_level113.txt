WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : binary
- the challenge will force the parent process to solve a number of arithmetic problems : 5
- the challenge will use the following arithmetic operations in its arithmetic problems : +*%
- the complexity (in terms of nested expressions) of the arithmetic problems : 3

ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will now perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the flag.
[TEST] Performing checks on the parent process of this process.
[TEST] Checking to make sure that the process is a custom binary that you created by compiling a C program
[TEST] that you wrote. Make sure your C program has a function called 'pwncollege' in it --- otherwise,
[TEST] it won't pass the checks.
[HINT] If this is a check for the *parent* process, keep in mind that the exec() family of system calls
[HINT] does NOT result in a parent-child relationship. The exec()ed process simply replaces the exec()ing
[HINT] process. Parent-child relationships are created when a process fork()s off a child-copy of itself,
[HINT] and the child-copy can then execve() a process that will be the new child. If we're checking for a
[HINT] parent process, that's how you make that relationship.
[INFO] The executable that we are checking is: /usr/bin/bash.
[HINT] One frequent cause of the executable unexpectedly being a shell or docker-init is that your
[HINT] parent process terminated before this check was run. This happens when your parent process launches
[HINT] the child but does not wait on it! Look into the waitpid() system call to wait on the child!

[HINT] Another frequent cause is the use of system() or popen() to execute the challenge. Both will actually
[HINT] execute a shell that will then execute the challenge, so the parent of the challenge will be that
[HINT] shell, rather than your program. You must use fork() and one of the exec family of functions (execve(),
[HINT] execl(), etc).
[FAIL] You did not satisfy all the execution requirements.
[FAIL] Specifically, you must fix the following issue:
[FAIL]    The process must be your own program in your own home directory.
