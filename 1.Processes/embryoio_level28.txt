WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : python
- the challenge will check that the environment is empty (except LC_CTYPE, which is impossible to get rid of in some cases)

[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be python3.8.
[FAIL] You did not satisfy all the execution requirements.
[FAIL] Specifically, you must fix the following issue:
[FAIL]    Executable must be 'python'. Yours is: bash
