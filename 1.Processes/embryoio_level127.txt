[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the flag.
[TEST] Performing checks on the parent process of this process.
[TEST] Checking to make sure the process is a non-interactive shell script.
[FAIL] You did not satisfy all the execution requirements.
[FAIL] Specifically, you must fix the following issue:
[FAIL]    The shell process must be executing a shell script that you wrote like this: `bash my_script.sh`
