WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : python
- the challenge will take input on a specific file descriptor : 1
- the challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : thgnlyxm

ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[TEST] This challenge takes input over stdout! Make sure to provide this file descriptor to the program, and send any required input over it.
[GOOD] Preliminary checks are okay on the input FD!
[INFO] This challenge will now perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the flag.
[TEST] Performing checks on the parent process of this process.
[TEST] We will now check that that the process is a non-interactive python instance (i.e., an executing python script).
[INFO] The process' executable is /usr/bin/bash.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be python3.8.
[FAIL] You did not satisfy all the execution requirements.
[FAIL] Specifically, you must fix the following issue:
[FAIL]    Executable must be 'python'. Yours is: bash
