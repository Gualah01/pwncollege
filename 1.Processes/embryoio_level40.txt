WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : bash
- the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdin : cat
- the challenge will check for a hardcoded password over stdin : hpvhikuz

ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will now perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the flag.
[TEST] Performing checks on the parent process of this process.
[TEST] Checking to make sure the process is the bash shell. If this is a check for the parent process, then,
[TEST] most likely, this is what you do by default anyways, but we'll check just in case...
[INFO] The process' executable is /usr/bin/bash.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be bash.
[GOOD] You have passed the checks on the parent process!
[TEST] You should have redirected another process to my stdin. Checking...
[FAIL] You did not satisfy all the execution requirements.
[FAIL] Specifically, you must fix the following issue:
[FAIL]    stdin of this process does not appear to be a pipe!
