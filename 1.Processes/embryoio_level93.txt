WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : shellscript
- the challenge will make sure that stdin is redirected from a fifo
- the challenge will make sure that stdout is a redirected from fifo
- the challenge will force the parent process to solve a number of arithmetic problems : 1
- the challenge will use the following arithmetic operations in its arithmetic problems : +*
- the complexity (in terms of nested expressions) of the arithmetic problems : 1

ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will now perform a bunch of checks.
