//TESTO

hacker@embryoio_level106:~$ /challenge/embryoio_level106 
WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : python
- the challenge will make sure that stdin is redirected from a fifo
- the challenge will make sure that stdout is a redirected from fifo
- the challenge will force the parent process to solve a number of arithmetic problems : 1
- the challenge will use the following arithmetic operations in its arithmetic problems : +*
- the complexity (in terms of nested expressions) of the arithmetic problems : 1

ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will now perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the flag.
[TEST] Performing checks on the parent process of this process.
[TEST] We will now check that that the process is a non-interactive python instance (i.e., an executing python script).
[INFO] The process' executable is /usr/bin/bash.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be python3.8.
[FAIL] You did not satisfy all the execution requirements.
[FAIL] Specifically, you must fix the following issue:
[FAIL]    Executable must be 'python'. Yours is: bash

//SOLUZIONE

//Primo Terminale
hacker@embryoio_level106:~$ mkfifo qin
hacker@embryoio_level106:~$ mkfifo qout
hacker@embryoio_level106:~$ nano my_script.py
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["/challenge/embryoio_level106"])
hacker@embryoio_level106:~$ python my_script.py < qin > qout

//Secondo Terminale
hacker@embryoio_level106:~$ cat > qin

//Terzo Terminale
hacker@embryoio_level106:~$ cat < qout
