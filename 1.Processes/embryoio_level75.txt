hacker@embryoio_level76:~$ /challenge/embryoio_level76 
WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
- the challenge checks for a specific parent process : python
- the challenge will check that the environment is empty (except LC_CTYPE, which is impossible to get rid of in some cases)
- the challenge will check that env[KEY] holds value VALUE (listed to the right as KEY:VALUE) : 69:axkshxtbre

ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will now perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the flag.
[TEST] Performing checks on the parent process of this process.
[TEST] We will now check that that the process is a non-interactive python instance (i.e., an executing python script).
[INFO] The process' executable is /usr/bin/bash.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be python3.8.
[FAIL] You did not satisfy all the execution requirements.
[FAIL] Specifically, you must fix the following issue:
[FAIL]    Executable must be 'python'. Yours is: bash
