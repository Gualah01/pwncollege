### Welcome to /challenge/babymem_level1.0!

The challenge() function has just been launched!
Before we do anything, let's take a look at challenge()'s stack frame:

Our stack pointer points to 0x7ffc0cfbbc40, and our base pointer points to 0x7ffc0cfbbd10.
This means that we have (decimal) 28 8-byte words in our stack frame,
including the saved base pointer and the saved return address, for a
total of 224 bytes.
The input buffer begins at 0x7ffc0cfbbc80, partway through the stack frame,
("above" it in the stack are other local variables used by the function).
Your input will be read into this buffer.
The buffer is 123 bytes long, but the program will let you provide an arbitrarily
large input length, and thus overflow the buffer.

In this level, there is a "win" variable.
By default, the value of this variable is zero.
However, when this variable is non-zero, the flag will be printed.
You can make this variable be non-zero by overflowing the input buffer.
The "win" variable is stored at 0x7ffc0cfbbcfc, 124 bytes after the start of your input buffer.
