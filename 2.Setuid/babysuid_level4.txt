Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level4!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
exposes you to very simple programs that let you directly read the flag.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/tail.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level4) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/tail!

//SOLUZIONE

hacker@babysuid_level4:~$ tail /flag
