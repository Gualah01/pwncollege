Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level50!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
just straight up weren't designed to let you read files.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/wget.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level50) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/wget!
