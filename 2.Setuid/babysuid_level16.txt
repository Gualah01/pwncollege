Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level16!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
require you to understand their output to derive the flag from it.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/split.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level16) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/split!

//SOLUZIONE

hacker@babysuid_level16:~$ split /flag flag
hacker@babysuid_level16:~$ cat flagaa
