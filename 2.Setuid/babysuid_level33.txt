Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level33!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
will require some light programming to read the flag..

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/whiptail.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level33) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/whiptail!
