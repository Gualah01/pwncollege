Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level10!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
require you to understand their output to derive the flag from it.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/rev.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level10) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/rev!

//SOLUZIONE

hacker@babysuid_level10:~$ rev /flag | rev
