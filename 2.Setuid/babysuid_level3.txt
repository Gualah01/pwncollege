hacker@babysuid_level3:~$ /challenge/babysuid_level3 
Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level3!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
exposes you to very simple programs that let you directly read the flag.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/less.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level3) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/less!

//SOLUZIONE

hacker@babysuid_level3:~$ less /flag
