Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level51!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
show you how dangerous it is to allow users to load their own code as plugins into the program (but figuring out how is the hard part!).

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/ssh-keygen.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level51) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/ssh-keygen!
