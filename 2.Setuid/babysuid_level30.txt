Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level30!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
will enable you to read flags by making them execute other commands.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/setarch.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level30) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/setarch!
