Welcome to EmbryoASMLevel15
==================================================

To interact with any level you will send raw bytes over stdin to this program.
To efficiently solve these problems, first run it once to see what you need
then craft, assemble, and pipe your bytes to this program.

We will now set some values in memory dynamically before each run. On each run
the values will change. This means you will need to do some type of formulaic
operation with registers_use. We will tell you which registers_use are set beforehand
and where you should put the result. In most cases, its rax.

In this level you will be working with the Stack, the memory region that dynamically expands
and shrinks. You will be required to read and write to the Stack, which may require you to use
the pop & push instructions. You may also need to utilize rsp to know where the stack is pointing.



In this level we are going to explore the last in first out (LIFO) property of the stack.

Using only following instructions:
push, pop
Swap values in rdi and rsi.
i.e.
If to start rdi = 2 and rsi = 5
Then to end rdi = 5 and rsi = 2

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
rdi = 0x1d3c3c71
rsi = 0xb46b0be

//SOLUZIONE

push rdi
push rsi
pop rdi
pop rsi
