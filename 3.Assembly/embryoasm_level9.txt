Welcome to EmbryoASMLevel9
==================================================

To interact with any level you will send raw bytes over stdin to this program.
To efficiently solve these problems, first run it once to see what you need
then craft, assemble, and pipe your bytes to this program.

In this level you will be working with registers. You will be asked to modify
or read from registers_use.

We will now set some values in memory dynamically before each run. On each run
the values will change. This means you will need to do some type of formulaic
operation with registers_use. We will tell you which registers_use are set beforehand
and where you should put the result. In most cases, its rax.

In this level you will be working with bit logic and operations. This will involve heavy use of
directly interacting with bits stored in a register or memory location. You will also likely
need to make use of the logic instructions in x86: and, or, not, xor.



Using only the following instructions:
and, or, xor
Implement the following logic:

if x is even then
  y = 1
else
  y = 0
where:
x = rdi
y = rax

We will now set the following in preparation for your code:
rdi = 0x14970f79

//SOLUZIONE

and rdi,1
xor rdi,1
xor rax,rax
or rax,rdi
