Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level22!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
force you to understand different archive formats.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/cpio.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level22) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/cpio!
