Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level5!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
exposes you to very simple programs that let you directly read the flag.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/head.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level5) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/head!

//SOLUZIONE

hacker@babysuid_level5:~$ head /flag
