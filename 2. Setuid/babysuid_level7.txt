Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level7!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
shows you that an over-privileged editor is a very powerful tool, indeed.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/vim.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level7) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/vim!

//SOLUZIONE

hacker@babysuid_level7:~$ vim /flag
